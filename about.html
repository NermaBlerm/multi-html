            <p> I chose to major in computer science because after I 
                graduated highschool I participated in the summer
                guild program for CUNY, girls who code and we were 
                taught how to build a website. I immediately 
                knew I wanted to pursue my career in CS. But honestly,
                 it has been really hard. I'm still not that familiar with 
                coding. I know the basics but because of the pandemic
                I've been set back. It's been a struggle for me understanding
                Java but I just have to push myself to get there. I used to
                my laziness get in the way but I want to make MONEYYYY 
                and actually understand the material. I'm going to be rich real 
                soon. Period. &#128181;&#128181;&#128181;&#128181;
